One goal of this project is to make "Problem Pages" version controlled.

Ideally, people could relate to problem pages in a similar way to git and github.

So one possible way to achieve that is by defining problem pages as plain text files, checked into git.

This is somewhat similar to how github wiki's are also backed by a git repo under the hood.

One interesting dynamic about this is that it would mean reading and editing the underlying file format would be incredibly easy and straight forward.

The "App" itself is more of a templating engine, that makes it easy to create these specialized documents.

We would still probably want specialized client software built to author and browse these plaintext documents more seamlessly.

But we would get all the git version control out-of-the-box.
