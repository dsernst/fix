## What is the problem?

## Who's affected by the problem?

## Could you argue that this isn't actually a problem?

## What could we measure whether we solved it or not?

## How much would you pay, to see it solved immediately?

## Could we coherently split this problem up into more specific sub-problems? Easier to solve individually.

## What possible solutions can we try?
    ### For each -> Solution evaluation
        - High level summary
        - How would it work?
        - What problems might that face? Why might it not work? [for each of those: ways to solve that sub-problem?]
        - Cost to test it?
        - Has anyone tried something like this already? What happened?
        - Would you pre-pledge donations to someone to carry this out? [they will have to pitch themselves again before you actually pay anything]

### Mapping the subproblems, and dependency relationships: Is it possible to solve one and thus others?
