# fix tool

This tool tries to help you or a group of people solve problems.

It's like a Bug Tracker, which programmers have found helpful for decades, but adapted to solve "real world" problems.

## Core Functionality:

1. **Add problems you want to see solved**
   1. For each problem, add proposed solutions
      1. For each proposed solution, identify reasons it might work, fatal flaws, open questions
   2. Specify which group of people is affected by the problem.

### I want help thinking through:

1. What are the highest priority problems I can solve?
2. Which of these problems actually have actionable solutions & paths forward?
3. Which solutions are the most promising? What are actionable next steps?
4. What are the flaws in solutions commonly proposed?
5. Which problems are blocked by other problems? And the reverse: by solving which problems, which other problems does that unblock?
6. Can I quickly get other people up to speed on my understanding of the problem?

I would expect a fully formed version of this tool to answer all the above questions.
