# fix-er tool

This tool tries to help you or a group of people solve problems.

It's like a Bug Tracker, which programmers have found helpful for decades, but adapted to help you solve "real world" problems.

## Core Functionality:

1. **Add problems you want to see solved**
   1. For each problem, add proposed solutions
      1. For each proposed solution, identify reasons it might work, fatal flaws, open questions
   2. Specify which group of people is affected by the problem.

### I want help thinking through:

1. What are the highest priority problems I can solve?
2. Which of these problems actually have actionable solutions & paths forward?
3. Which solutions are the most promising?
4. What are the flaws in solutions commonly proposed?
